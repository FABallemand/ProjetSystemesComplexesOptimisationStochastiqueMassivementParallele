\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, we first used evolutionary algorithms to find the mass of the
earth, the mass of the sun and the speed at which the earth revolves around the
sun. EA proved to be able to solve these problems without any issue and in a
short time.\\
The second part of the project was dedicated to the recovery of Newton's
universal law of gravitation. However, during this part, Easena prevented us
from implementing our solution as we wanted. We then had to improvise and use a
different approach to solve the problem. This approach was successful, but it
was not as effective as we had originally planned. Nevertheless, we were able
to complete the project and obtain valuable information about the process, such
as the influence of the parameter on the convergence speed and the quality of
the final results.\\

Now that we know that genetic programming is capable of finding a physical law
from simple observations and constants, it would be interesting to see if GP is
also capable of finding more complex models such as the Navet-Stokes equations,
which describe fluid flow, perhaps by taking advantage of the acceleration
offered by island parallelism with GPGPU.\\
